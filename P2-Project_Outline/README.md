### Overview
Include overview here

Hey!  Are you starting your natural hair journey?  Do you care about someone who is or thinking about starting their natural hair journey but doesn't know where to begin?  There are tons of products, information and directions needed to successfully complete this journey and I have a program that is here to help.
This program will search through all of the many hair care products and find the perfect set of products tailor made for your hair type.  This can be very useful to those who are on their natural hair journey, searching for products that will make their lives a lot easier.  This idea came about watching my wife become frustrated with wrestling with her and our daughters hair.  Continuously buying product after product just for that product not to have the desired results.  If I can just help people narrow down that choice to save them time, money and energy.
